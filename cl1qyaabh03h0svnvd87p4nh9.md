            Security mavens will want to download the most recent version of Microsoft's security-analyzer
            tool, Microsoft Security Baseline Analyzer (MSBA) 1.2. The tool, which runs on Windows
            Server 2003, XP, and Windows 2000 systems, now includes support for Microsoft Exchange
            Server 2003 and all Microsoft BizTalk Server versions. MSBA 1.2 scans for common security
            misconfigurations on a long list of products (see the URL below). You can download
            MSBA 1.2 from the Microsoft Web site.&#160;
