## WiMAX in Sri Lanka!

<p><a href="http://www.lankanewspapers.com/news/2006/3/6105.html">This</a> is so friggin cool and I thought were so behind on things. SLT has already installed and is testing out WiMAX broadband wireless in Sri Lanka.</p>
<p>If these guys can get the price point just right like they did with ADSL, it&rsquo;s going to be really sweet.</p>
