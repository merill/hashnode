## Dell Studio: Slow mouse (touchpad) and missing keys issue

<p>Just before I installed Windows 7, the new Dell Studio suddenly started slowing down. The touchpad movements would be jerky and some keys wouldn’t get pressed. A post on a dell support forum outlined the same problem that I had and the keys the other user reported were the exact same ones. </p>  <p>What’s even worse is that the support site is so bad I can’t even locate that forum post. But here are a couple I found reporting the same problem (<a href="http://yourmidnightsnack.wordpress.com/2008/08/14/new-dell-studio-laptop-problems-oh-no/">one with keyboard problems here</a> and <a href="http://en.community.dell.com/forums/p/19246719/19388641.aspx#19388641">another with touchpad problems</a>).</p>  <p>Draining the battery power was one suggestion but couldn’t be bothered doing that, I just went with updating the BIOS to the latest version (A05) and viola that fixed it.</p>  <p>So here’s to anyone having the same problem with a Dell Studio where the whole machine goes into slow motion when moving the mouse with the touchpad as well as when punching in the keys into the keyboard go missing. Solution: Update your BIOS to the latest version.</p>
